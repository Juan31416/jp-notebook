# Notes on Common Lisp

SBCL is an open-source implementation that is delivered from Carnigie Mellon University. This is the version that I'm currently using.

## Concepts

- **Read-Eval-Print Loop:** That endless cycle of reading, evaluating, and printing _(REPL)_.
- **Self-evaluating object:** Which means that when given to the evaluator, the E in REPL, it evaluates to itself.
- **List:** Anything in parenthesis.
- **NIL:** Lisp's version of false and/or null.
- **Functions:** Basic program building blocks in Lisp and can be defined with a _DEFUN_.
- **FORMAT:** function is the most flexible way to standar output.
- **T:** Means everything loaded correctly

## Notes - Apr 11, 2023

Lisp, in general, evaluates lists by treating the first element as the name of a function and the rest of the elements as expressions to be evaluated to yield the arguments to the function.

_Strings_, like _numbers_, have a literal syntax that's understood by the Lisp reader and are self-evaluating objects.

**FORMAT** function is the most flexible way to standar output.
FORMAT takes a variable number of arguments, but the only two required arguments are the place to send the output and a string.
If you pass t as its first argument, it sends its output to standard output.

```clojure
;HELLO WORLD VARIABLE
"Hello, World!"
```

```clojure
;FULL HELLO, WORLD PROGRAM
(FORMAT t "Hello, World!")
```

```clojure
;FULL HELLO, WORLD PROGRAM PACKED IN A FUNCTION
(defun hello-world () (format t "hello, world"))

;CALLING THE CREATED FUNCTION
(hello-world)
```

> Debugging a program running on a $100M piece of hardware that is 100 million miles away is an interesting experience. Having a read-eval-print loop running on the spacecraft proved invaluable in finding and fixing the problem.
