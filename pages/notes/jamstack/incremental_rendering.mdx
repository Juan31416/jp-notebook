# Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

▶️ _allows content editors & developers to use static generation on a per-page basis & udpate content without having to rebuild the entire site._

A way to build a static site with thousands of pages with the following features:

- Update content in a matter of seconds.
- Without the need to rebuild or redeploy the whole site.
- Design for more than a cache.

Pros:

- No waiting time for content to update.
- None extensive compilation time.

Cons:

- For a "realtime" application, you don't want to make users wait.
- Server rendering will make the user wait.
- For minimal sites.
