# Hey Visitor! ðŸ¤™

Welcome to my notebook! You can find some raw notes of things I'm curious about or exploring.

The project's primary goal is to share some concepts I want to keep close around. Recently, as an exploration of my consciousness, I realized that there are some tendencies to be **distracted** and **hyperactive** while learning new things.

As a possible solution, I'm probing ways to channel all that energy by creating notes using Mdx-Markdow.

Hopefully, If you find out about this experiment, it will help whatever purpose you're digging in.

## Specials Thanks

The creation of this **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** notebook wouldn't be possible without the great team behind [Nextra](https://nextra.site).
