# Hey Visitor! ðŸ¤™

Welcome to my notebook! You can find some raw notes of things I'm curious about or exploring.

The notebook's primary goal is to share some concepts I want to keep around. Recently, as an exploration of my consciousness, I realized that there are some tendencies to be **distracted** and **hyperactive** while learning new things.

As an experimentation, I'm probing ways to channel all that energy by creating notes using Mdx-Markdow.

If you find something helpful about this experiment, let me know, and feel free to share it with the world.

## Specials Thanks
